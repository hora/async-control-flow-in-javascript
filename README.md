# Asynchronous Control Flow in JavaScript

_Note: This repo collects the lecture notes and code examples I created
for Lighthouse Labs (W2D2)._

## Recap - Functions and Callbacks

### What are functions?

- separate bits of code

- usually named (ex: `function printName`)

- ideally serve a single purpose (ex: `function add`)

- can optionally take in 'arguments' – these are inputs to
  the function

- can optionally `return` a value – this is the output of
  the function

### Why are JavaScript functions 'first-class functions'?

- because in JS, functions are Objects:
    
    - they can be assigned properties

    - they can be assigned to variables

    - they can be passed as arguments or return values

### What are 'higher order' functions?

- higher order functions are functions that take other
  function(s) as parameter(s), or that return another
  function

### What are callback functions (or callbacks)?

- a callback is a function F1 that is passed to another
  F2, and that F2 'calls back' as a result of its
  operations

- examples we've seen:

    - [Array.prototpye.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)

    - [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)

## Synchronous JavaScript

- Until today, we've been working with synchronous JS.
  This means our code gets executed in order, in a 'single
  thread.'

- We looked at an example of ordering food at a
  restaurant. Preparing the food synchronously means
  someone might have to wait a really long time to get
  their order.

- In such a case, the execution is **blocked** until the
  computation is completed. To users, it may look like the
  program is **hanging** and unresponsive.

- One possible solution to this problem is to use
  asynchronous code instead.

Note: The example we looked at together is in
[/parts/04-synchronous-js-example.js](https://github.com/hora/lhl-w2d2/blob/master/parts/04-synchronous-js-example.js).

## Asynchronous JavaScript

- Async code is code that does not execute immediately,
  but at some specified later time or when a particular
  event is triggered.

### `setTimeout`

- `setTimeout` runs a function after a set amount of time
  has passed.

```js
// Syntax
// delay is specified in milliseconds (1 second = 1000 ms)

const timeoutID = setTimeout(callback, delay[, ...args]);

// Example

setTimeout(function(){
   console.log('Five seconds later...');
}, 5000);
```

See the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) for more details.

Note: The examples we looked at together are in
[/parts/06-asynchronous-js-example.js](https://github.com/hora/lhl-w2d2/blob/master/parts/06-asynchronous-js-example.js)
and [/parts/06a-asynchronous-js-example2.js](https://github.com/hora/lhl-w2d2/blob/master/parts/06a-asynchronous-js-example2.js).

## Async code and scope

- Scope is a bit trickier when working with async code.

Note: The examples we looked at together are in
[/parts/07-async-scope1.js](https://github.com/hora/lhl-w2d2/blob/master/parts/07-async-scope1.js)
and [/parts/08-async-scope2.js](https://github.com/hora/lhl-w2d2/blob/master/parts/08-async-scope2.js).

## Events

- Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the
  system you are programming, which the system tells you
  about so you can respond to them as needed.

- The system will give a signal when an event occurs, so
  that the appropriate response (that is, a callback
  function) is taken.

- As we're programming, we have no way of knowing when
  events will occur – working with events is therefore
  working with _asynchronous_ code.

- An **Event Handler** is a callback function that will be
  called when an event is triggered.

Note: The example we looked at together is in
[/parts/11-mystery-example.js](https://github.com/hora/lhl-w2d2/blob/master/parts/11-mystery-example.js).

## `process.stdin` and `process.stdout`

- `process.stdin` and `process.stdout` are two features of
  Node.js we can use to read user input from the 'standard
  input source' and to provide output to the 'standard
  output source.'

- In our case, both `stdin` and `stdout` are the console.

### `stdin.on`

- `stdin.on` is a function that takes an event and a
  callback as arguments. When the event is triggered, the
  callback is invoked.

```js
// Syntax

process.stdin.on(event, callback);

// Example

process.stdin.on('data', function() {
   console.log('Received data from stdin.');
});
```

### `stdout.write`

- `stdout.write` is a function that writes to the console.
  Note that it does not write a 'new line' (`'`n`'`), but
  that we have to do that ourselves (if we wish to).

```js
// Syntax

process.stdout.write(string);

// Example

process.stdout.write('Hello, world!\n');
```

Note: The example we looked at together is in
[/parts/13-stdin-stdout-example.js](https://github.com/hora/lhl-w2d2/blob/master/parts/13-stdin-stdout-example.js).
